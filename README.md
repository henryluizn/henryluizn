# Whose is this Git?

My name is Henry Nauffal. I'm a software developer and support analyst

Python is my favorite language at momment.

I use it in my work to develop applications that make day-to-day support team easier.

My focus of studies at the moment is web development using Python in the back-end and HTML/CSS & JS in the front-end.



No, I don't have only few repositories and commits.

My repositories are private due to confidential project information.

My projects have an emphasis on the following technologies:

  - Image processing with Python, Scikit-Learn and OpenCV.
  - Python in back-end for Web Development and applications in general.
  - Data processing
  - Flask/Django with JINJA.
  - HTML/CSS & JS.
